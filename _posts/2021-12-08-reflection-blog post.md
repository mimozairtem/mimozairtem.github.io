In this blog post, I will reflect on my experience of completing the project. 

1) As a group, we developed a platform that identifies mental health disorders according to information provided by the patient. Our platform helps classify mental disorders and support the clinician with diagnosing the mental health disorder. Also, it may raise awareness and encourage people to seek help. 
We have worked with a large dataset with multiple variables, which is eventually evaluated by a machine learning algorithm. We have provided the machine learning model to develop an indicator or classifier to determine the mental health state of a person to support early detection. We have created a Webapp that analyzes the given data to finally predict an outcome regarding the patientâ€™s mental health. 

2) I am especially proud on how we focused on a topic like mental health, which is significantly important in our lives but is  mostly disregarded. Mental health is something I am really passionate about, therefore, creating a project that might help people who are suffering from mental disorders made me feel really proud. In addition to this, I felt especially proud how we managed to write a coding project that delivered most of our plans and at the end it was something meaningful. 

3) It was really hard to find a dataset with a large amount of data and different variables that we could use for our machine learning model. So I will suggest finding more data about mental health, even though there is not enough on the Internet because it is sort of a taboo topic. Another thing I would suggest for further improving the project is adding a section on the internet about resources for mental health and maybe providing assistance with mental health such as consulting. 

4) We probably achieved everything we proposed in our planned deliverables. We created a machine learning model to develop an indicator to determine the mental health state of a person to support early detection. Yet, due to the limited variables of the dataset, a larger dataset will give more accurate results than our current model. Our accuracy is not high compared to other machine learning models, but the dataset and the topic restricted us from achieving a higher accuracy level. 

5) First of all, I learned how to use Github and use a collaborative GitHub repository, where we could see each other's commits. In addition to this, we also used Google Collab which enabled us to observe the changes in the code simulateously. Also, this was my first time using tensorflow in a project, so it was really exciting to witness how it worked. Lastly, Jenel gave the idea about using a package called pywebio for web development. This package made it easier for us to create the web app and also helped me learn another technique for web development. 

6) I think this project not only help me with coding but also understanding how a coding project is created. In PIC16A, we only created several machine learning models according to the project prompt. But because we were free with any project ideas and had the develop the whole project on our own, it was a really good growing opportunity for me. I think this experience prepared me for collaborative working environments in further studies or maybe career as well. I witnessed how a coding project is created from scratch without any instructions. This will definitely help me be a group member who voices her opinions more in my next classes.
